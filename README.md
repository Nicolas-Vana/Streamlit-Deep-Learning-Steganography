# Streamlit based app for Deep Learning Steganography
This repository contains the all the python code and models required to build my streamlit app that does image-image steganography using deep convolutional neural networks. Image-image steganography can be used for a variety of purposes such as watermarking and hiding information in plain sight. This method has also been show to [perform better than other previously available steganography methods](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/14/7/1325) when considering image metrics such as the peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). A more in-depth explanation of the model and its usage can be found hosted on streamlit share at:
